# magic-hat

iOS app for managing a Magic: The Gathering collection and decks. SwiftUI +
SwiftData, iOS 26 (Liquid Glass), native UI throughout.

## Commit rules

- Every commit message MUST begin with one of: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`.
- Keep the subject imperative and concise.
- Do NOT add AI/Claude authorship or `Co-Authored-By` trailers.

## Build

Full Xcode is required (Command Line Tools alone can't build SwiftData/SwiftUI
macros). If `xcode-select -p` points at CommandLineTools, either switch it
(`sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`) or prefix
build commands with `DEVELOPER_DIR`:

```
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer \
  xcrun xcodebuild build -project magic-hat.xcodeproj -scheme magic-hat \
  -sdk iphonesimulator26.0 -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator'
```

The project uses file-system-synchronized groups, so new files added under
`magic-hat/` are picked up automatically — no `.pbxproj` edits needed.

## Architecture

Layered so responsibilities stay isolated. Views and controllers are kept in
separate top-level folders, each sub-sorted by feature (Collection, Decks,
History, Search). Shared layers (Models/Clients/Utils) stay flat because they
are cross-cutting, not owned by one feature.

- `App/` — app entry, `ModelContainer` schema.
- `Views/<Feature>/` — SwiftUI views only (presentation).
- `Controllers/<Feature>/` — feature logic that orchestrates models + clients
  (e.g. `ImportController`, `CardHydrationController`).
- `Models/` — SwiftData `@Model` types and plain value types.
  - Structure is flat: `MTGCollection` → cards. A collection shows all its
    cards in one grid; binder is stored on each entry as metadata, not a
    navigation level.
  - `MTGCollection` — a named collection (unique name). Import targets one
    collection: a new one, or an existing one to merge into.
  - `CardMeta` — cached Scryfall metadata (image URLs, dims), keyed by
    Scryfall ID; one per card, shared across collections.
  - `CollectionEntry` — one owned row (collection + binder + finish +
    condition + qty); mirrors a ManaBox CSV row. CSV fields are denormalized
    so the collection is browsable before hydration. `binderName` is retained
    as metadata (used to filter which rows to import) but not navigated.
  - `AuditRecord` — append-only ledger. Records sharing an `actionID` come
    from one user action; each has a signed `quantityDelta`. Backs the
    History tab and future undo/redo.
  - `ManaBoxRow` — parsed CSV row (the on-disk import schema).
- `Clients/` — API clients. Only describe endpoints + request/response
  shapes.
  - `ScryfallClient` — `/cards/:id`, batched `/cards/collection`,
    `/cards/search` (printings by oracle id), `/sets/:code`. Primary source
    for card data, images and a single market price per finish.
  - `MTGJSONClient` — second provider, bulk-only (no per-card endpoint):
    `<SET>.json` per set and `AllPricesToday.json`. Its value is the full
    retail picture (low/mid/market/buylist across TCGplayer, Cardmarket,
    Card Kingdom) that Scryfall does not expose. Prices are keyed by MTGJSON
    UUID, so join via `identifiers.scryfallId` from a set file
    (`scryfallToUUID(setCode:)`). `AllPricesToday.json` is tens of MB —
    only ever fetch it from an explicit user action with progress.
- `Utils/` — cross-cutting infrastructure, no API-specific logic.
  - `HTTPClient` — transport, required headers (User-Agent/Accept), decoding.
  - `RateLimiter` — actor enforcing Scryfall per-endpoint limits.
  - `CSVParser` — RFC-4180-ish parser + ManaBox mapping.
  - `PrintingsCache` — "all printings of this card" by oracle id. Written to
    disk with a 7-day TTL (printings only change when a set releases), so
    cold launches don't re-run searches. The card overlay warms it for the
    card on screen, debounced, so opening the detail screen is instant.
  - `SetSymbolLoader` — see Set symbols below.
  - `ImageLoader` — card image cache: original bytes on disk (Caches/),
    decoded+downsampled UIImages in memory keyed by URL+size. Decode and
    downsample run on the actor (off-main) via ImageIO so scrolling never
    triggers a main-thread decode of a full-resolution image.
- `Controllers/Collection/`
  - `ImportController` — applies a parsed import (add/replace), writes audit.
  - `CardHydrationController` — fetches card metadata (whole collection, then
    viewport top-ups) and refreshes stale prices. Bumps `revision` on every
    write so views can rebuild without a second unbounded query.

## Rate limits (Scryfall)

Enforced in `RateLimiter`. `/cards/search|named|random|collection` 2/sec,
`/cards/manifest` 10/min, everything else (incl. images) 10/sec. All requests
send an accurate `User-Agent` (`MagicHat/1.0`) and an `Accept` header.

## Keep work off the main thread

Responsiveness is a hard requirement: the UI must never lag or freeze. Any
non-trivial work — file I/O, parsing, decoding, networking, image processing,
bulk data writes — belongs off the main thread.

- Put pure, CPU-bound work (CSV parsing, decoding) on a background task
  (`Task.detached(priority: .userInitiated)`), then hop back to update state.
- Mark pure value types / helpers `nonisolated` so they don't inherit the
  project's default MainActor isolation and can run off-main without warnings
  (e.g. `ManaBoxRow`, `CardFinish`, `CSVParser`, `HTTPClient`).
- Networking runs off-main via `nonisolated` clients + `RateLimiter` (an
  actor); never block on the main thread waiting for a request.
- SwiftData `@Model` types are main-actor-bound under this project's default
  MainActor isolation, so their writes happen on the main context. For large
  writes, chunk the loop and `await Task.yield()` between batches so the run
  loop stays responsive, and surface progress (e.g. a progress bar) rather
  than blocking behind a spinner.
- Long-running user actions should show progress and keep the UI interactive
  (or explicitly disable only the controls that must not change mid-operation).

## Reusable card UI

Card browsing is built from generic, source-agnostic components so Search can
reuse them later (they take plain values, not SwiftData/Scryfall models):

- `CardItem` (Models/) — presentation value type for one card. Build it from
  `CollectionEntry`+`CardMeta` (owned) or, later, from a `ScryfallCard`
  (search). Carries `owned` so non-owned results can dim.
- `CardGridView` — 3-wide grid of `[CardItem]`; `onAppearIndex` lets the
  parent hydrate/prefetch. Tap → overlay; overlay eye → detail push.
- `CardOverlayView` — enlarged card in a horizontal pager that peeks
  neighbours; swipe flows through the grid. Info panel + Liquid Glass action
  bar (only the eye action is wired; others are placeholders).
- `CardDetailView` — hero art header, gameplay text, Versions/Ruling tabs,
  and all printings (grouped by set) with owned indicators.

Pricing: Scryfall provides only a single market price per finish
(`prices.usd` / `usd_foil`) — that is what we show (no LOW/MID tiers).

Why LOW/MID is not available yet, measured rather than assumed:

- **MTGJSON has no tiers.** Verified against `AllPricesToday`: the shape is
  `paper.<vendor>.{retail|buylist}.{normal|foil|etched}.<date> = one float`.
  One retail and one buylist number per vendor — no low/mid/market.
- **It cannot be parsed on device anyway.** 5.2MB gzipped, 53MB decoded,
  ~660MB peak RSS to parse. iOS would terminate the app. There is no per-set
  or per-card price file, so it is all-or-nothing.
- **The identifier join is affordable but moot.** Per-set files are ~1.1MB
  gzipped and immutable once a set ships, so `scryfallId -> uuid` is cheap
  per set; the blocker is the price file, not the mapping. (The MTGJSON uuid
  is a v5 UUID but is not reproducible from Scryfall fields by concatenation,
  and relying on an undocumented hash recipe would be brittle regardless.)

So LOW/MID/MARKET comes from **TCGplayer's own API**, joined via
`CardMeta.tcgplayerID`, which Scryfall hands us free in the batch call we
already make — one request, no bulk download, no UUID mapping.

TCGplayer no longer issues public API keys, so those tiers are unavailable to
us at any price. We show the single Scryfall market price and nothing else.

### Scryfall bulk data

Scryfall now publishes bulk **only as `jsonl_download_uri`** (`.jsonl.gz`) —
line-delimited, so unlike MTGJSON's single giant object it can be streamed and
parsed a line at a time at constant memory. That makes an on-device catalog
feasible. Measured: `oracle_cards` 24.7MB gz (~35k unique cards),
`default_cards` 78.8MB gz (~112k printings), `rulings` 5.4MB.

Card lines carry `image_uris` as **URLs**, never image bytes, so a catalog
download does not affect image storage — images keep streaming lazily into the
existing disk cache. Lines also carry `prices`, so a catalog refresh doubles
as a price refresh.

Not yet implemented. The shape it should take:
1. `GET /bulk-data`, compare `updated_at` with the stored value; skip if same.
2. Stream `URLSession.bytes`, inflate with the `Compression` framework
   (the file is `.gz`, served without `Content-Encoding`, so Foundation will
   not decompress it for us — strip the gzip header and raw-inflate).
3. Decode one line at a time, upsert `CardMeta` in batches of ~500 with
   `Task.yield()`, showing determinate progress against `compressed_size`.

`oracle_cards` (25MB) is the right first target: it powers the empty Search
tab, at a third the size. It holds one printing per oracle id, so it does NOT
cover the specific printings a collection references — owned cards keep using
batched `/cards/collection`. It should be **opt-in and Wi-Fi-preferred**, not
an automatic first-launch download.

MTGJSON **set files carry no prices** (verified) — only `identifiers`,
`legalities`, `foreignData`, `purchaseUrls` and similar. Prices live solely in
the bulk price files, so pricing cannot be fetched per set during import.

### What MTGJSON IS good for on device

Its bulk *price* and *card* files are too big (above), but several artifacts
are small, and some carry data Scryfall has no equivalent for. Measured:

| File | Size | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `Meta.json` | 113 B | Check before any larger download |
| `Keywords.json` | 4 KB | Fine |
| `CardTypes.json` | 7 KB | Fine |
| `EnumValues.json` | 19 KB | Fine |
| `DeckList.json` | 634 KB | Fine — 3,059 precons |
| `decks/<name>.json` | ~150 KB | Fine — one precon |
| `<SET>.json.gz` | ~1.1 MB | Fine per set, immutable once shipped |
| `SetList.json` | 11.6 MB | Use Scryfall `/sets` (623 KB) instead |
| `AllPricesToday.json` | 53 MB / 660 MB RSS | Server only |
| `AtomicCards.json.gz` | 52 MB | Server only |

**Preconstructed decks are the clear win** — Scryfall has no deck data at all,
and every deck card carries `identifiers.scryfallId`, so a precon joins
directly to the cards we already store ("which of these do I own?").

Per-set files additionally carry things Scryfall does not: `foreignData`
(bundled translations — relevant because ManaBox exports a Language column),
`leadershipSkills` (can this be a commander?), `edhrecSaltiness`, and
`variations`. All at 1.1 MB per set, cached permanently.

Buylist pricing (what a shop pays you) remains MTGJSON-only and remains
server-side-only, because it lives in the 53 MB price file. The
overlay shows the gain/loss vs the price paid at import (`CollectionEntry
.purchasePrice`) as `(±$Δ, ±%)`.

Set symbols: Scryfall serves set icons as SVG only, and SwiftUI cannot decode
a remote SVG. `SetSymbolLoader` rasterizes it once via a WKWebView snapshot,
caches it, and `SetSymbolView` renders it as a `.template` tinted `.primary`
so it adapts to light/dark. Two non-obvious constraints: WebKit only paints a
web view that is **in a window**, and `takeSnapshot` captures the view at its
own alpha — so the render host is a real `UIWindow` layered *behind* the app
(`windowLevel = .normal - 1`) at **full alpha**. Rendering it faded produced a
near-transparent image that, as a template, was invisible.

## Data flow notes

- **Card metadata is fetched for the whole collection, not just what scrolls
  past.** `CardHydrationController.hydrateAll` batches every id through
  `/cards/collection` (75 per request), applying per chunk so the grid fills
  progressively. Viewport-only hydration left most cards with no price or
  rarity, which silently broke every sort that keys on them.
- The sync runs as a **visible second phase of the import wizard** ("Fetching
  card data"), dismissable because it continues on the shared controller
  regardless. It also starts and resumes when a
  collection is opened. It is idempotent (`neededIDs` skips what is already
  fetched), so an interrupted run simply continues. It holds a background-task
  assertion so it survives the app being backgrounded briefly. `BGTaskScheduler`
  was deliberately not used: iOS gives no timing guarantee, and the work is
  attended and resumable.
- `CollectionEntry.card` is a real SwiftData relationship to `CardMeta`, and
  the grid's query sets `relationshipKeyPathsForPrefetching = [\.card]`. This
  replaced a second unbounded `@Query` over every `CardMeta` row plus a
  dictionary join rebuilt on each change.
- **Prices go stale, metadata does not.** `CardMeta.pricesUpdatedAt` drives
  `refreshStalePrices`, which re-fetches only cards older than
  `CardHydrationController.priceTTL` (6h) through the same batched endpoint.
- Images live on disk (Caches/), not in SwiftData, to keep the store small.
- The grid rebuilds its `[CardItem]` on a **debounced** schedule: a full sync
  emits one SwiftData save per 75-card batch, and remapping thousands of items
  on each would thrash the main thread.

## Sorting

Every comparator in `CollectionCardsView.sorted` must define a **total order**,
falling through to name and then id. `Array.sorted` is not stable in Swift, so
any key shared by many cards (e.g. every card with no price) otherwise comes
back in arbitrary, reshuffling order. Missing prices sort as 0, to the bottom.
